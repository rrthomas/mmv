This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of mmv.

This package was put together by Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from USENET.

It was maintained by Bernd Eckenfels <ecki@debian.org> with some
enhancements (NLS Char Support, glibc compiles) from Bernd and kind
contributions from Hartmut Koptein <koptein@et-inf.fho-emden.de>.

At the moment it is maintained by Rhonda D'Vine <rhonda@debian.org>

However, Vladimir told me:

Michael,

This message is to serve as an announcement that I am changing the
copyright of mmv to GPL.

If this message is in any way insufficient to do so, please tell me what
I have to do. Please keep in mind that I do not have in hand either the
full GPL text or the source code of the last mmv release (oops).

If there is any other way that I can help out, please tell me.

Thanks,

Vladimir Lanin
