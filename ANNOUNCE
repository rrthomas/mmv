This is mmv, a program to move/copy/append/link multiple files
according to a set of wildcard patterns. This multiple action is
performed safely, i.e. without any unexpected deletion of files due to
collisions of target names with existing filenames or with other
target names. Furthermore, before doing anything, mmv attempts to
detect any errors that would result from the entire set of actions
specified and gives the user the choice of either aborting before
beginning, or proceeding by avoiding the offending parts.

Improvements over mmv's predecessor, ren:

. support for BSD, System 5, and MS-DOS

. source and target files may (usually) reside in different directories

. paths may contain wildcards

. supports all csh wildcards: '*', '?', '['...']', and '~'

. the ';' wildcard finds files at any level in the tree

. can copy, append, or link instead of moving/renaming

. reads multiple patterns from standard input (or one from command line)

. no-execute option (whose output can be fed back in on standard input)

Note to users familiar with ren: the -a and -k options have been renamed
to -t and -g, respectively, and their semantics have somewhat changed.
