# gengetopt for mmv
purpose "move/copy/link multiple files by wildcard patterns"
usage " [-m|-x|-r|-c|-o|-a|-l|-s] [-h] [-d|-p] [-g|-t] [-v|-n] FROM TO"

description "The FROM pattern is a shell glob pattern, in which `*' stands for any number
of characters and `?' stands for a single character.

Use #[l|u]N in the TO pattern to get the string matched by the Nth
FROM pattern wildcard [lowercased|uppercased].

Patterns should be quoted on the command line."
